# cwebp-simplify
This repo is for cwebp to make it easier and faster to use.

## run-folder.bat
This script asks for a specific folder and every file changes their filetype to ```.webp```.
It can delete all original files and use original file name or numbers as file name.
It supports ```.png```, ```.jpg``` and ```.jpeg (not fully supported!)```
